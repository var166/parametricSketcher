IntroductionThe project presented in this document is the description of the Parametric Sketcher. The Parametric Sketch Editor is a CAD-oriented software tool designed to facilitate the precise creation and manipulation of 2D geometric entities. The main objective is to provide engineers, designers, and students with an efficient environment for drafting and analyzing technical drawings with both accuracy and flexibility.The application will enable users to construct geometric shapes, apply geometric and dimensional constraints. Additionally, it will include support for parametric curves and splines essential for modeling complex, real-world structures.2 General view of actors and use casesThis chapter should give a brief description of the actors interacting with the system (the types of external users, user groups and external entities).  I t also should describe the use cases present in the system.Here is an example of the actors’ table (in case of an e-commerce project):ActorTypeDescriptionAdministratorHumanThe person administrating the system, adding functionalities and fixing issues..StudentHumanPerforms general operations over the system, such as drawing, making projections, for educational purposes.Library maintainerHumanMakes libraries with predefined shapes, presets, which should cater to different types of usersCAD DesignerHumanTakes advantage of all functionality of the application, the proficient user which uses the application in a work environment.3 Detailed description of actors and use cases3.1 Actors3.1.1 AdministratorType: humanDetailed description:This actor maintains the application, constantly listening to feedback and improving functionalities or fixing issues related to the application.Where is used:This actor is used in the:  “Administrates libraries” use case			    “Administrates good use of app” use case			    “Makes library entries” use case			    “Maintains functionality of application” use case			    “Drawing and designing” use case			    “Downloading models or libraries” use case3.1.2 StudentType: humanDetailed description: This actor is the student, studying engineering or architecture, looking to get introduced to CAD using this application, whose usage is straightforward.Where is used:This actor is used in the: “Drawing and designing” use case			    “Downloading models or libraries” use case			    “Learning CAD” use case				                                                            3.1.3 Library manager  Type: humanDetailed description: This actor is a human whose role is creating and managing libraries of presets for the application. These libraries will contain presets suited for different types of applications, as the tools used for designing a PCB and a bridge are similar, but not quite the same.Where is used:This actor is used in the: ”Maintaining good use of application” use case			     “Creating and managing libraries” use case3.1.4 CAD designerType: humanDetailed description: This actor is a human whose role is using all functionalities of the app in order to create accurate and useful technical or artistic drawings.Where is used:This actor is used in the: “Drawing and designing” use case			     “Downloading models or libraries” use case			     “ Creating and managing libraries” use case	 			    3.2 Use cases3.2.1 Use Case Diagram for AdministratorDescription:Actor: AdministratorPrecondition: Is logged into the systemPostcondition: Changes are synchronized to all other clientsBehavior: The administrator reviews user feedback on a bug in the "Drawing and designing" feature, updates the application to fix the issue, and adds a new library entry for a popular CAD toolset in the "Makes library entries" use case.3.2.2 Use Case Diagram for StudentDescription:Actor: StudentPrecondition: Student account is activePostcondition: Has designs drawn and savedBehavior: he student opens the application, follows a tutorial in the "Learning CAD" use case to create a simple 2D drawing, and downloads a library of basic shapes in the "Downloading models or libraries" use case to practice.3.2.3 Use Case Diagram for Library managerDescription:Actor: Library ManagerPrecondition: Has a valid account with edit rights on librariesPostcondition: Creates and optimizes libraries for different usagesBehavior: The library manager creates a new preset library for PCB design in the "Creating and managing libraries" use case and ensures its proper integration by monitoring usage in the "Maintaining good use of application" use case.3.2.4 Use Case Diagram for CAD DesignerDescription:Actor: CAD DesignerPrecondition: Has an account, is logged in.Postcondition: Creates sketches in different domainsBehavior: The CAD designer uses the application to draft a detailed technical drawing of a bridge in the "Drawing and designing" use case, downloads a relevant model library in the "Downloading models or libraries" use case, and contributes a custom preset to the "Creating and managing libraries" use case.4 Glossary – used termsThis chapter should contain all the key items or terms or entities the application deals with.  Here is an example were the glossary terms are defined:TermUse casesDescriptionCADAllComputer Aided Design acronym.Libraries and modelsDownloading libraries or modelsThe presets or methods used in different applications of CAD.	Terms with related meanings and/or that are used in similar contexts can be grouped by term groups as depicted in the following table.Term GroupsIncluded terms and term groupsDescriptionAuthenticationAdministrator password authentication, Provider password authenticationDefines a general group of credentials used in the authentication processUTCNName of the StudentVarga AndreiGroup: 30433System requirements for <Parametric Sketcher>Page5/5Code: T_SWDP_System_RequirementsUTCN Name of the StudentVarga Andrei Group: 30433System requirements for <Parametric Sketcher>Page1/5Code: T_SWDP_System_RequirementsRecommended:(date, signature)Approved:(date, signature)Company Name:Address:3400 Cluj-Napoca RomaniaPhone: Fax:     E-mail:Web: Format: T_GENERAL, Version: 1
